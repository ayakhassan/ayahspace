            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <div class="question-group">
                <div class="question-header">
                    <h3>1. What interests you about Darlins?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>I first came across the Darlins on my Instagram while researching UT orgs, and my initial thought was ‚ÄúWow, these girls look like a diverse group of baddies‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt think much more about it at the time, but I later referenced them in one of my UT application essays. However, it wasn‚Äôt until I started attending recruitment events that I realized the depth of the community each Darlin contributes to. The more I attended, the more I felt at ease, especially after the DEI event, which helped me realize that I wasn‚Äôt just there to get in, I was there to connect with both the actives and other recruits I met. In a large and often non-inclusive environment like UT, being in a space where we could simply be ourselves, relate to one another, and truly understand each other was something I didn‚Äôt expect. It‚Äôs this sense of sisterhood and belonging that I want to be a part of during my time at UT.</p>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <div class="question-group">
                <div class="question-header">
                    <h3>2. What could you contribute to Darlins?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>Although the Darlins are the official spirit organization for both the men's and women's basketball teams, I‚Äôve noticed that basketball, particularly the women‚Äôs team, doesn‚Äôt receive the same level of support and outreach as the football team. While football is undeniably popular in the U.S., just like LSU, our basketball teams are highly competitive and deserve similar recognition and excitement. I believe we could increase support for the women‚Äôs basketball team by implementing strategies to boost student engagement, whether through game week celebrations, interactive fan experiences, or other initiatives that bring the same energy and enthusiasm seen at football games.</p>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <div class="question-group">
                <div class="question-header">
                    <h3>3. What do you think Darlins represent?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer-text">
                    <p>To me, the Darlins represent a multitude of things, but perhaps most importantly, they represent a community, one that thrives on supporting each other, growing together, and creating a sense of belonging. In a world where academic stress constantly piles on, the Darlins serve as a reminder that we don‚Äôt have to navigate this journey alone. They are not just a support system for one another; they serve a larger purpose on the UT campus, too. They create a space where anyone who feels out of place or overwhelmed can find a home, a community that welcomes, and a place that draws others in to feel seen, understood, and included. I got to experience this sense of belonging during the short, but comforting time of recruitment, where I felt welcomed by the warmth and openness of the group, even as someone just getting to know them.</p>
