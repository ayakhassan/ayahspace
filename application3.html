        <h3>8. If a song played every time you entered a room, what would it be?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="writing-space">
        <div class="write-line">If a song entered every time I walked in, it would be “Oncle Jazz” by Men I Trust. It quite literally was every morning on the way to school because I was so obsessed.</div>

      <div class="writing-space">
        <div class="write-line">Like the narrator in The Fig Tree by Sylvia Plath, I often find myself overwhelmed by the countless possibilities life offers. There are so many paths I want to explore—learning every language, mastering every skill, traveling the world, becoming a professional chef, pursuing a law degree, and reading every book. The thought of not being able to live out every version of my life is something I struggle to accept, as it feels like there’s just so much to experience, and I don’t want to miss any of it.</div>

      <!-- Question 10 -->
      <div class="question-header">
        <h3>10. If you were a city, which one would you be and why?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="writing-space">
        <div class="write-line">It’s insane to think about Sudan, Texas, because for a long time, when I’d tell people where I was from, they’d just nod and smile. Even though I’m from the country of Sudan, I often felt more like I was from Sudan, Texas. Growing up, I didn’t always feel at home in a room full of Sudanese people. My Arabic vocabulary and knowledge of Sudanese dishes often felt scrutinized, which left me questioning whether I was truly from Al Fao, Sudan, or if my identity was more rooted in Lamb County, Sudan, Texas. (I claim Sudan the country btw (˵¯͒⌄¯͒˵)).</div>
