    <div class="write-in-area">
      <!-- Question 4 -->
      <div class="question-header">
        <h3>4. How have the organizations you’ve been in shaped you as a person?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="writing-space">
        <div class="write-line">Joining my school's student council and computer science club in my senior year was a pivotal moment for me. It was the first time I found myself in a space with people all working toward the same goal, bettering our environment and introducing others to a space that thrives on learning and growth. Through these experiences, I met incredible individuals who helped shape the person I wanted to become. These spaces allowed me to unlock parts of my personality that I had kept hidden and gave me the opportunity to truly appreciate my current major. I was able to showcase my leadership and coding skills, while also nurturing my inner growth. Most importantly, I found a sense of community with people I once only passed in the hallways, making it clear that being in the right environment can truly help you be yourself.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 5 -->
      <div class="question-header">
        <h3>5. If you could plan a sisterhood event, what would it be and why?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="writing-space">
        <div class="write-line">I would plan a Spirit Gear Crafting Night and/or Spirit Gear Thrift Flip Day. Game day outfits can often be expensive, and finding the right pieces at a fair price can be a challenge. So, I’d love to create an opportunity for everyone to come together and DIY pieces to wear for games or go thrifting together and flip items to make them unique. It would be a fun way to enhance each other's wardrobes, share style tips, and foster creativity while also bonding over a shared goal of showing support for our teams.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 6 -->
      <div class="question-header">
        <h3>6. What is your biggest weakness? Strength?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="writing-space">
        <div class="write-line">I’d say my biggest weakness is that I have a tendency to avoid asking for help, even when I really need it. I often keep my thoughts and feelings bottled up, thinking I should figure things out on my own. But taking on leadership roles and stepping into unfamiliar spaces helped me see that this isn’t always the best approach. I realized that everyone has their own doubts and struggles, and that being vocal about them—especially in leadership—helps move past those barriers. Even though I’ve made progress, there are still times, especially as a Computer Science student, when that old habit creeps up. That’s why I believe joining the Darlins would help me push past that bubble and continue growing in a supportive environment.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 7 -->
      <div class="question-header">
        <h3>7. Describe a time when you failed and what you learned from it.</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="writing-space">
        <div class="write-line">Although it might sound cliche, fall semester was when I felt like I hit rock bottom. I got so caught up in the excitement of being in a new place, away from home, with all these new rules and experiences, that I lost sight of why I was actually here—to get an education. I forgot that, while having fun is important, academics should come first. I felt the pressure building when I was close to failing a class, but I kept little reminders by my bedside: 1. it’s not the end of the world, and 2. I was in a completely new environment, so it’s normal to feel out of balance while I adjust. I ended up passing the class after a lot of struggle, but that struggle taught me a big lesson, life after high school is really what you make of it. Even though we’re all in a bubble again, this one is much bigger, tougher, and demands more thought and consideration in everything we do.</div>
